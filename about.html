        <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
        <d1>
            <dt>Burpee</dt>
            <dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strenghth and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position</dd>
    
        <dt>Plank</dt>
        <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get into a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can</dd>
        
        <dt>Mountain Climbers</dt>
        <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio excersize. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
